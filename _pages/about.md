My research applies **machine learning** and **advanced computational methods** to solve complex problems in process systems engineering. I work on topics such as sensor placement design, process modeling, estimation, soft sensing, process monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis, using techniques like supervise/unsupervised machine learning, dynamic mode decomposition, variational inference, Kalman filtering, reinforcement learning, and optimization. While rooted in process systems, my work also aims to impact energy systems, smart manufacturing, molecular systems, and healthcare applications.

If you are excited to work or collaborate on such topics, please feel free to reach out to me [(Email: abc@iitd.ac.in)](mailto:abc@iitd.ac.in) -->
